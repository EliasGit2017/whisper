00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
I'm a Lama Duma Lama you assume I'm a human what I gotta do to get it through to you

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,840
I'm super human innovative and I made a robber so that anything you say can speak a shagging off of me

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,880
And it'll be you and devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give them all the fucking audicates

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,840
I feel like it's never fading never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting for the day to think

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,120
Cause yeah I fell off to be celebrating cause I know the way to get them motivated I make elevating music

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,520
You make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they can tell us to confuse it

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
It's not hip hop it's pop cause I found a colorway to fuse it with rock, shockwrap, whipdop

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
Throw and lose yourself I make them lose it

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,120
I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,520
Let me know when it occurs to you while I'm ripping anyone of these verses

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:59,680
It's you it's curtains I'm inadvertently hurting you
