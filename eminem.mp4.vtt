00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
I'm a Lama Duma Lama you assume I'm a human what I gotta do to get it through to you

00:02.720 --> 00:05.840
I'm super human innovative and I made a robber so that anything you say can speak a shagging off of me

00:05.840 --> 00:08.880
And it'll be you and devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give them all the fucking audicates

00:08.880 --> 00:11.840
I feel like it's never fading never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting for the day to think

00:11.840 --> 00:15.120
Cause yeah I fell off to be celebrating cause I know the way to get them motivated I make elevating music

00:15.120 --> 00:19.520
You make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they can tell us to confuse it

00:19.520 --> 00:24.480
It's not hip hop it's pop cause I found a colorway to fuse it with rock, shockwrap, whipdop

00:24.480 --> 00:26.080
Throw and lose yourself I make them lose it

00:26.080 --> 00:29.120
I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use

00:29.120 --> 00:31.520
Let me know when it occurs to you while I'm ripping anyone of these verses

00:31.520 --> 00:59.680
It's you it's curtains I'm inadvertently hurting you
